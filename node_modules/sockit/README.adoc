This project is designed to create a database that synchronises client session data with a configured websocket host
asynchronously. This allows an angular application to be built entirely off html5 local and session storage technology,
and means that the client data can be kept up-to-date at all times. User requests are handled as session-scoped queues,
and therefore support offline web-application functionality.
